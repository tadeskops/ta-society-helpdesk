## Setup runbook (one-time, in order)

| # | When | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Fresh deploy | Create a Google OAuth Web Client ID; add `https://tadeskops.github.io` + `http://localhost:8080` as authorised origins. |
| 2 | Fresh deploy | Create a Cloudflare account; install Wrangler (`npm i -g wrangler`); `wrangler login`. |
| 3 | Fresh deploy | Create a fine-scoped GitHub PAT for this repo with `issues:write` + `contents:write` only. |
| 4 | Fresh deploy | (Optional) Create a Cloudflare Turnstile widget; copy site key + secret. Skip if shipping with `FEATURE_DAILY_TURNSTILE` off. |
| 5 | Fresh deploy | `cd worker && npm install`. Replace `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` + `TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` in `wrangler.toml`. |
| 6 | Fresh deploy | Set Worker secrets: `wrangler secret put GITHUB_TOKEN`; `wrangler secret put BOOTSTRAP_DEVELOPERS` (your email); `wrangler secret put TURNSTILE_SECRET` if used. |
| 7 | Fresh deploy | `cd worker && npm run deploy`. Update `config/site.json` → `system.workerUrl` + `system.turnstileSiteKey`. |
| 8 | Fresh deploy | Push to `main`. Pages serves from `docs/`; workflows fire. |
| 9 | Fresh deploy | First developer signs in at `https://tadeskops.github.io/ta-society-helpdesk/settings.html`. Worker bootstraps via `BOOTSTRAP_DEVELOPERS`. Add canonical `config/developers.json` from Settings → Access lists, then **remove** the `BOOTSTRAP_DEVELOPERS` secret. |
| 10 | Fresh deploy | Developer adds manager + committee emails from Settings → Access lists. |
| 11 | Fresh deploy | Developer reviews feature flags + system bindings on Settings. |
| 12 | Fresh deploy | On the handover repo, set `DAILY_TRACK_URL` → this site's URL. |
| — | Anytime | Operators triage from manager / committee dashboards. |
| — | Anytime | Bulk-archive runs on cron + on demand from committee dashboard. |
